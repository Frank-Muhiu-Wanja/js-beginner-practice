# JavaScript Beginner Roadmap 🚀

This repository contains daily JavaScript practice exercises, organized into folders.  
Each folder focuses on a single beginner-friendly topic, with simple examples using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The aim of this project is to help anyone (including myself) strengthen core JavaScript fundamentals through small, practical micro-projects.

---

## 📦 What Each Folder Contains

- `index.html`
- `script.js`
- `style.css` (optional)

Every folder represents one concept for easy learning and revision.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Practice JavaScript **every day**
- Understand core concepts through small, simple examples
- Build a strong foundation before moving to advanced topics
- Keep learning consistent and structured

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

JavaScript can get complex very fast — frameworks, libraries, servers, and APIs.  
But none of those make sense unless the fundamentals are sharp and well-understood.

At the end of the day, **basic fundamentals are the foundation of an impeccable project.**

Hope it comes in handy.
